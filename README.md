# About the game

Hello there! Having experience programming in web development, we wanted to branch off to something new and learn how to develop a game. 
In just a mere _**2 weeks**_, we learned how to navigate Unity, write in C#, and create a game purely from scratch. We took this opportunity to learn as much as we could about game development in such a short period!

Pixel Punchers is a 2D side-scrolling action game where the player takes on the role of a hero fighting against hordes of enemies in order to save the world from destruction. The game is heavily inspired by classic side-scrolling action games like Streets of Rage, which was released in the early 1990s and went on to become a cult classic. Streets of Rage has since spawned several sequels and spinoffs, including a recent release that sold over 2.5 million copies.
